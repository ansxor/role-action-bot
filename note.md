# Anonymous Questions
The user should be able to send an anonymous message via DM to a bot. When sending a message
the bot should probably prompt the user about which category to send the message to.

Maybe it should be like the following?:

- User sends message
- Bot prompts the user about which channel to send the message into (and to change the server as last emoji)
- Bot sends the message into the questions channel with an anonymous alias and also mirrors the message with an attachment to identity in a private channel.

# Scheduling
There should be some simple way to have scheduling done and have users and roles assigned specifically who would be attached.
